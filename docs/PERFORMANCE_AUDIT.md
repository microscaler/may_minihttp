# may_minihttp Comprehensive Performance & Coverage Audit

## 1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

may_minihttp is a coroutine-based HTTP/1.1 client and server built on the `may` runtime stack. The library provides both server-side HTTP handling and a native HTTP client (under the `client` feature flag).

### Architecture Summary
- **Server**: `may::net::TcpStream` → coroutine per connection → `httparse`-based request parser → `HttpService` trait → `Response` builder → wire encoding
- **Client**: `HttpClient` → `BufferIo<TcpStream>` → `http` crate integration → `BodyReader`/`BodyWriter` → TCP connection
- **Runtime**: `may` stackful coroutines with non-blocking I/O on Unix, blocking I/O elsewhere
- **Dependencies**: `httparse` (parsing), `bytes` (buffer management), `itoa` (number formatting), `may` (coroutines/networking)

## 5. GAP ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Critical Gaps (High Severity)

| Gap | Domain | Current State | Impact |

| **Concurrent connection scaling** | Server | No test measures throughput vs connection count (1-100) | Unknown scalability limits; coroutine scheduler performance unmeasured |
| **Pipelined request throughput** | Server | Supports multi-request-per-connection loop | No E2E test measures how many requests pipelined before buffer fills |
| **Keep-alive connection overhead** | Server + Client | Server supports it; client does NOT | Connection setup cost is unknown baseline |
| **Large body POST throughput** | Client + Server | BodyWriter has unit tests | No E2E test for 10KB-1MB POST body transfer end-to-end |
| **Response body read throughput** | Client | BodyReader has unit tests | No E2E test measuring client read performance at 1KB-10MB |
| **Concurrent multi-client throughput** | Server | Server spawns per-connection coroutines | No test measures aggregate throughput under N concurrent clients |

### 5.3 Low Gaps (Minor Severity)

| Gap | Domain | Current State | Impact |
|-----|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Error response wire format** | Server | `encode_error()` exists | No E2E test sends request that triggers 500 response |
| **Malformed response E2E** | Client | Unit tests decode error | No E2E test sends garbage response to verify client error handling |

## 7. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TEST SUITE

### 7.1 Body Size Throughput Test

**Requirement:** Measure server throughput across body sizes.
**Method:**
- Server echoes request body back in response
- POST with body sizes: 1B, 100B, 1KB, 10KB, 100KB, 1MB
- Run with 1, 5, 10 concurrent goose users for 60s each

- [ ] Responses return in correct request order
- [ ] No response interleaving or corruption

### 7.4 Chunked Body E2E Test

**Requirement:** Verify chunked Transfer-Encoding works end-to-end.
**Method:**

- [ ] Client does not hang on timeout
- [ ] Connection cleaned up after timeout

### 7.9 Slow Client / Buffer Drain Test

**Requirement:** Verify server handles slow clients without memory issues.
**Method:**

- Server must buffer and parse headers without filling memory
- Measure: server memory growth, parsing correctness, error handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Server handles 1000-byte-per-request slow clients without OOM
- [ ] Request parsing succeeds or fails cleanly (no partial parsing)
- [ ] Memory usage stable over 100 slow client requests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All response sizes read correctly (content integrity verified)
- [ ] Throughput >= 50 MB/s for bodies >= 100KB
- [ ] Memory usage proportional to body size (no leaks)

```

### 8.2 Design Principles

1. **RAII Fixture Pattern** — Server starts on port 0 (random), stops on Drop
2. **Timing Harness** — Wrap request/response with `std::time::Instant` for latency tracking
3. **Goose Integration** — Use goose for multi-user concurrency tests
4. **Native Client Only** — Use `may_minihttp::client::HttpClient` (not may_http)
5. **No External Dependencies** — All tests self-contained, no live database required
6. **CI-Parity** — Tests must run in Docker container without network access

### 8.3 Example Fixture Pattern

```rust
use std::net::SocketAddr;
use std::sync::Arc;
use may_minihttp::{HttpServer, HttpService, HttpServerWithHeaders, Request, Response};
use may;

pub struct TestServer {
    addr: SocketAddr,
    handle: std::thread::JoinHandle<()>,
}

impl TestServer {
    pub fn new<F: HttpService + Clone + Send + Sync + 'static>(service: F) -> Self {
        // Bind to port 0 for random port
        let server = HttpServer(service);
        let handle = server.start("127.0.0.1:0").unwrap();
        let addr = /* extract from listener... */;
        Self { addr, handle }
    }

    pub fn addr(&self) -> SocketAddr { self.addr }
}

impl Drop for TestServer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // Signal shutdown, join handle
    }
}
```
